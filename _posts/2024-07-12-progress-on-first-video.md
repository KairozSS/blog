I started to work on a video about a year ago.

Initially I did it sparingly. There was a time I didn't do anything for like 4 months or more.

But since February of this year, I've been doing a lot. Perhaps... too much, especially when I consider it the first video that I make seriously. 

The video is about how Youtube was made and it covers the year 2005-2006. Seeing how things are going it's probably going to be an hour long.

I... just want to share some thoughts while I'm still creating the video.

## July 12th
Currently I'm rewriting the video script. The script was like 34 pages, and I feel I already have the final version of the video for the first 15 pages. 

Right now my process is rewriting like 3 or 4 pages and then produce the video for those pages. 

The reason why I'm currently rewriting things, it's because I realized that some sections didn't get to the point quickly or were just boring. Good thing is that when I rewrite, sometimes those 3 pages become 1 or 2 pages. Other times I just cut entire pages.

Before all this I produced the video using the old script, because I thought it was good enough. 

I did that for 32 pages. 

Yea... I know, it feels like that was a waste of time and work. But this is the first time I do something like this, and inefficiencies like that were bound to happen. Besides I can reuse most of that footage anyway.

Now that I'm rewriting things and re-recording my voice, I think I should speak slower.
